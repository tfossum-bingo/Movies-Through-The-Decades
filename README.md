# Movies-Through-The-Decades

## Overview 
After searching for a movie based on partial title, the site will return a collection of movies with a similar title released 10 years prior.

## API
This project utilizes the OMDb API:

This project might also utilize the following API for book data:

## Use Cases:
Following is a notional list of use cases. While not granularly decomposed, they provide an overview of the funcitonality and some suggestion of the iterative delivery.
* As site user I want to be able to see information about the site so I know how to use it.
* As a site user I want to be able to submit a search so it knows what title interests me.
* As a site user I want to be able to see what movie matched my search so I know what the other movies are referenced against.
* As a site user I want to see a list of matching titles from 10 years prior to the first match so I can peruse some fun oldies.
* As a site user I want to be able to clear the search results so I can search again.
* Stretch Goals:
    * As a site user I want to be able to select movie and compare it's information against the primary hit so I can see how they're different.
    * As a site user I want to be able to drag-and-drop the movie I want to compare against the primary hit, because that makes it easy for me.
    * As a site user I want to be able to optionally check if there's a book of the same title as one of the search results, because reading is fundamental.
